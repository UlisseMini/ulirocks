I felt like writing a list of interesting programing languages for people who care.
NOTE: Interesting does not mean "better then everything else at everything", also many popular programming languages get the job done but are not on this list (like python) because they are already established.

Here's the list in no perticular order, also won't be commenting on them much since their website can usually sell it quite well.


- [Elm](https://elm-lang.org) Compiles to JS no runtime exceptions, pure FP

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) Memory safe, no race conditions low level programming

- [Julia](https://julialang.org/) Fast python competitor, many cool features

- [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) Highly reliable systems, concurrency

- [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/) pure FP, TYPES TYPES TYPES!

- [Racket](https://racket-lang.org/) Amazing metaprogramming capibilities, UI, Learning.

If you've got suggestions send them to `uli#4334` on discord or `ulisse.mini@gmail.com` by email, I love checking out languages :)
