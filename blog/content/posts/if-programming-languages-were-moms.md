This is clearly biased from the languages I like better, hopefully fun to read anyways.

**Rust** Is kindly and protective. A bit overreaching at times but you know its for your own good, and if you beg her she'll let you do whatever you want.

**Haskell** Is an overprotective parent, You might understand her rules better if you had a PhD in math and studied category theory though.

**Python** Is a huge proponent of teamwork, often when you want to do something she will immediately find 5 experts in the topic, she can be quite slow though if you need to do something yourself.

**Javascript** Only uses email, she hates speaking directly as then she can't deal with other messages (single threaded)

**Go** Is an expert in multitasking, In stark contrast to javascript she often keeps multiple conversations going at the same time while cooking and sweeping.

More are to come!, you can also send suggestions [here](/about).
