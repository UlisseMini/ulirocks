      <description>This is clearly biased from the languages I like better, hopefully fun to read anyways.
Rust Is kindly and protective. A bit overreaching at times but you know its for your own good, and if you beg her she&amp;rsquo;ll let you do whatever you want.
Haskell Is an overprotective parent, You might feel better about her rules if you had a PhD in math and studied category theory though.
Python Is a huge proponent of teamwork, often when you want to learn something she will just point out that there Is someone you know that can already do that, and you should ask them instead.</description>

      <description>I hate javascript But I&amp;rsquo;m using it to write a discord bot, for a few reasons (mostly the awesome discordjs api) I desided it was the easiest way to get my friends into programming via writing discord bots.
So, I thought it would be cool to add encryption-decryption functionality to my bot.
I&amp;rsquo;m a perfectionist so I wanted nothing less then aes256-gcm + a good KDF (I picked scrypt), Since I&amp;rsquo;m quite minimal, I desided to use the crypto package provided by node Instead of grabbing an insecure unmaintained package from npm.</description>
